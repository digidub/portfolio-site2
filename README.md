## Skills Employed

In building this project I leveraged the following concepts and technologies:

- **Svelte (& SvelteKit)**
  - This was my first time using Svelte (and SvelteKit)! Building components using this framework was extremely straightforward, as all front-end concerns(JavaScript, HTML and CSS) can be kept in each .svelte component file.
  - Svelte stores are a simple way to subscribe to and update application state.
  - Svelte's logic blocks for conditional and async rendering make displaying data simple and charming to implement.
  - SvelteKit's use of the `/routes/` directory to easily create SPA routing.
- **Deploying with Netlify**
  - This was my first time using Netlify and I got to grips with using this in conjunction with GitHub for continuous deployment.
